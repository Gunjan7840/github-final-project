# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a **Simple Interest Calculator** that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## 📌 Formula Used

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount  
- **R** = Rate of interest (per annum)  
- **T** = Time period (in years)

## 🧮 How It Works

1. The user enters:
   - Principal amount  
   - Rate of interest  
   - Time period  
2. The calculator applies the formula  
3. The simple interest is displayed as output  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript / Bash Script (as applicable)

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` – User interface  
- `script.js` / `calculator.sh` – Logic for calculation  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## ▶️ Example

If:
- Principal = 1000  
- Rate = 5%  
- Time = 2 years  

Then:
- Simple Interest = 100  

## ✅ Conclusion

This project helps beginners understand how simple interest is calculated and how basic programming logic works.
